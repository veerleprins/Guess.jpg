## :black_nib: Description

During the course _Real Time Web_ within the Minor Web Design & Development ([@cmda-minor-web](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web)) we learn to create a real time application using socket.io.

This repository shows a real time web application about ...

## :file_folder: Packages

There are a number of packages that have been downloaded for creating this application.

<details style="margin: 1em 0;">
  <summary style="margin: 1em 0;">Dev Dependencies</summary>

#### nodemon

The package [**nodemon**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is installed in the developer dependencies. Nodemon is a tool to ensure that the server is automatically restarted after changes have been made to one of the files. It helps the developer, among other things, by keeping an eye on whether there are changes that could cause possible bugs.

<details style="margin: 1em 0;">
  <summary style="margin: 1em 0;">Dependencies</summary>

#### express

The [**express**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) package is a framework for Nodejs. The reason why this package was downloaded is because express makes it easier to start a routing via the server. In addition, it supports many template engines that make it easier for this project.

#### ejs

The template engine [**ejs**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs) ensures that javascript code can be injected on the client. The reason this package was downloaded is because ejs makes it easier to inject the data sent from the server into the client.

#### express-ejs-layouts

The package [**express-ejs-layouts**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-ejs-layouts) is a layout for ejs that works with express. The reason why this package has been downloaded is because it does not create any open tags in the .ejs files at, for example, the body and html tag when coding in the DRY (**D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself) way.

#### dotenv

The package [**dotenv**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) is a kind of module that ensures that variables are released from an .env file. The reason this package was downloaded is because dotenv helps to store sensitive data (keys of an API), among other things, without it being visible to everyone when the GitHub repo is downloaded.

If nvm has been successfully installed, you can check the version by typing the following line of code in the terminal and pressing enter:

`nvm --version`

### 2. :open_file_folder: Clone folder

Then you need to download this project and open it with your code editor. To do this, open your terminal with the correct path in which you want this repository. **Example**:
